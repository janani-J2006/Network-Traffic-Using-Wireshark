# Network-Traffic-Using-Wireshark
## 📌 Overview
This project involves capturing and analyzing network packets on a Kali Linux virtual machine using Wireshark. The goal is to observe ICMP, DNS, and TCP protocols through specific network activities.

---

## 🖥️ Environment
- **OS:** Kali Linux (running in VirtualBox VM)
- **Tools Used:**  
  - Wireshark (for packet capture and analysis)  
  - Terminal commands: `ping`, `curl`

---

##  Steps Performed


 1. Updated Kali Linux and installed Wireshark:

'''sudo apt update
sudo apt install wireshark -y'''


2. Opened Wireshark and started capturing packets

Selected my network interface (e.g., eth0 or enp0s3).

Clicked the blue shark fin icon to start capture.



3. Checked for ICMP packets

In the terminal, I ran:

'''ping google.com'''

In Wireshark, I typed icmp in the filter box to see ICMP packets.

Took a screenshot.


4. Checked for DNS packets

When I pinged or used curl, DNS packets were automatically generated (because the system had to resolve google.com).

In Wireshark, I used the filter dns.

Took a screenshot.


5. Checked for TCP packets

In the terminal, I ran:

'''curl http://google.com'''

In Wireshark, I used the filter tcp to see TCP packets.

Took a screenshot.


6. Saved my Wireshark capture

Saved the capture file as network-capture.pcap.

Files Included
network-capture.pcap — The saved Wireshark capture.

networkcap.pcap — The saved Wireshark capture.

icmp.png — Screenshot of ICMP packets.

dns.png — Screenshot of DNS packets.

tcp.png — Screenshot of TCP packets.
